<h4>To open game, please open 'main.py' with your python console, not IDE</h4>

current status: ABANDONED. Feel free to do whatever u want with it. Im very grateful to this project cuz it taught me a lot of things in somewhat game development. But still, i decided to go with C# in terms of raylib as its more comfortable for me and way better for performance. If you interested in my FNaF 2 on raylib - check out "FNaF2-RaylibCs" on my profile.
